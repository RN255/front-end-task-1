## Project Name: Loan application Front End Test
This is a front end for a loan application. Users can type in a desired loan amount and select the repayment period.

## Motivation
This project was part of a job application. I was given a sample of a web page and I had to re-create it myself.

## Tech used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Project features
- fully responsive web design
- HTML forms
- user side form validation - The page will display an error message if the user doesn't enter the correct information.

## Lessons learnt
- The page was not actually fully mobile responsive at first, it was responsive in my chrome window, but didn't quite work on mobile. I forgot to add a line of code in the meta.
- I used innerHTML on the forms and was told not to as it is not completely safe.
- I was not too familiar with form validation but after checking online I managed to come up with something reasonable.
- I admitted to the interviewer that I was not familiar with form validation, they told me that I shouldn't admit this kind of thing because it doesn't sound good.

## future development
- It could be expanded to have other sections and pages, maybe a screen telling the user what they have asked for.
- The logo is just a picture I have, it could be changed to another logo, some text or a png file.
