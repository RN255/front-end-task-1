# front-end-task-1

Web page is live at: https://rn255.github.io/front-end-task-1/

I have completed this task as part of a job application process.

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The logo is just a picture I have, it could be changed to another logo, some text or a png file.

The page will display an error message if:
- the user doesn't enter a value into the loan amount section
- the user enters anything other than numbers into the loan amount section
- the user doesn't select a loan term

I tested it on mobile view in VScode and it seems to work on mobile screens too.

In order to complete this I often had to check back on my old projects and look some thing up on the internet.
I was not too familiar with from validation, but after checking on w3schools I think I managed to put together something reasonable.
